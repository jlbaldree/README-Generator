## Description 

An application that automates the README construction process. It allows a user to provide the content for a README file and translates it into the necessary markdown format.

* [Instructions](#instructions)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [License](#license)
    
## Installation
    
*Here are the steps to install the necessary components to run the program*
    
A `.gitignore` file containing `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` directory is needed to prevent issues with GitHub. The file should be created before npm dependencies are installed. The repo will need to include a `package.json` by running `npm init` in the initial project setup. If any visual aids are to be included in the README file, they will need to saved in an assets folder before the README generating process.
    
## Usage 
    
*Instructions on how to run and use the program*
    
To run the application, intiate the user prompts by typing `node index.js` in the terminal and then answer the questions.
